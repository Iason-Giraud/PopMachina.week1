### What do you expect from Pop Machina Academy?
================================================================

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pop Machina academy, will be a overview of the circular economy movement and a crash course in all necasairy skills that a maker champion needs to hone down in order to support his local fablab or maker space. The idea of a fablab that specializes in circular economy, rests on serendipity, meaning finding resourceful ways of taking advantage of local resource chains, identifying ways to transform waste from one production process into input of another. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that way the already established paradigm of contemporary production PITO (Products in- Trash out) will gradually transcend into DIDO (data in- Data out)
